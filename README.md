# NodeJSTreehouseAPI
Retrieves JavaScript scores for TeamTreehouse usernames entered via command line arguments. Uses try/catch, status code conditional, and regular expression to ensure all errors are appropriately handled.

Requires node.js running on local machine, and a list of one or more TeamTreehouse account names.

Example run:
> node treehousescore.js ScottRatigan
User ScottRatigan has 644 JavaScript points.

(I'm sure the score will be much higher by the time you read this!)
